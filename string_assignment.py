In Python, mutable and immutable refer to whether an objectâ€™s value can be changed after it's created. Mutable types can be modified in place, meaning their content can be changed without creating a new object. Examples of this include lists, dictionaries, and sets. On the other hand, immutable types cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that tries to alter them will actually result in the creation of a new object with the modified value. Examples of immutable types include integers, floats, tuples, and strings.
This concept directly applies to strings in Python. Since strings are immutable, you cannot change a single character in a string once it's created. If you try to modify a string, Python creates an entirely new string object with the change, rather than altering the original string. This behavior is important to understand when you're manipulating text, as it can impact performance and how you manage memory in your programs.

#Describe the role of escape characters in Python strings. Give examples.
Escape characters in Python are used to represent characters that are difficult or impossible to type directly into a string, such as newlines, tabs, or quotes. They start with a backslash (\), which tells Python to treat the next character in a special way rather than as a literal character.
For example, if you want to include a double quote inside a string that's enclosed in double quotes, you use the escape character \" to prevent Python from ending the string too early. Similarly, \n represents a newline, causing the text to move to the next line when printed, and \t represents a tab space.
